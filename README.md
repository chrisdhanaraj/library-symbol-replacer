## Overview
Replace symbols in the current document with symbols from a Library.

Sketch 47 sees the introduction of Libraries, but migrating existing files to use Library symbols is one of the first big headaches. This plugin aims to help with that.

## Installation

[Download zip](https://github.com/zeroheight/library-symbol-replacer/releases/download/1.0.4/library-symbol-replacer.sketchplugin.zip), unzip and double click the `.sketchplugin`

## Usage
### Preparing Libraries
* Copy-and-paste your symbols into a different Sketch document
* Make that document a Library ([see Sketch docs if you need help](https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/libraries/adding-libraries))

### Using the plugin
* Open a document where you want to replace symbols with Library symbols
* Run the plugin
* Select the Library file using the "Choose" dialog
* The plugin will tell you what replacements it thinks it can make
* When the replacements are done, it will also ask you if you want to delete the symbols which have been replaced

## Issues
* It is currently quite dumb and just uses symbol names to match symbols - that's because symbol IDs can be different, depending on how you copy and paste thing around
* Hopefully the overrides should be fairly resilient, but there are a few Sketch bugs I came across while implementing this, so I had to work around those
* It won't work for replacing Library symbols with other Library symbols - this could be a future improvement
